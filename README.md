Hi,


I am posting this for anyone to use, i spent a few days creating a wall panel to be used with Home Assistant.  I chose the Waveshare ESP32 7" Touchscreen due to its price and size.  My goal was to create ea touch panel similar to what you see in Star Trek.  

I have shared my YAML code, now I am no programmer, i needed Grok AI to help me with some of the code.  So take it as it is.  I have also included some automations that i use so the screens brightness can be controlled by home assistant.

This is not supported out of the box and requires soldering a wire on the back of the device to gain that funtionality.  Ther is a great post here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/esp32-s3-7inch-capacitive-touch-display-adjust-brightness/771030 that gives you instructions on doing that.

I have also included the background image.  Feel free to modify that anyway you wish.

I hope this helps.
